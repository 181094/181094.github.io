Historian, terrible cook, and a huge fan of dogs

May Lord Ganesh be with you. I should have Taco-night with margaritas. Weekend goal.
Anshul got into Yale. He has decided to abandon us and go to a conservative school (even though he's never tasted an avocado). We may need to brief him before he goes.
Anshul is very proud of his native country, India. He loves his college as it's the best in India (amongst top 20 in the world).
